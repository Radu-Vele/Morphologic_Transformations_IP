Feedback:
- Region filling
    - specify legend
    - (done) add a frame with both dilated on right and g/r on left
    - (done) make it faster after a while (after bottom corner) (total about 20 sec)
        - options use imageMagik in cmd (need to run on linux)

- erosion/dilation
    - smaller distance between zoom in areas and full view
    - color the eroded pixel in red (remove the "after" top image)
    - dilation - can remove the top right zoom in
        - maybe add the kernel by itself

- general:
    - make it more compact
